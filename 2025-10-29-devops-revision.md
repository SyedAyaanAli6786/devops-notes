# DevOps – Quick Revision Notes
## Security Testing (Intro Level)

SAST → Analyzes source code before execution

DAST → Tests the application while it is running

SCA → Scans third-party libraries and dependencies

Detects security issues early in the development cycle

## CI/CD Workflow (Step by Step)

Fetch code from repository (Checkout)

Install required dependencies

Perform code quality checks (Linting)

Build the application

Execute automated tests

Run security scans

Generate artifact (Docker image / build output)

Deploy to staging or production

Ensures faster, consistent, and reliable deployments

## DevOps Lifecycle (Continuous Flow)
Lifecycle Stages

Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor → Repeat

DevOps is an ongoing, continuous process
